# ActivePlanner

## Problem Statement 
It’s recommended that adults should have 150 minutes to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity a week. However, research shows that 25% of American adults are completely sedentary, which increases the risk of having chronic conditions in this population. 

This project aims to use activity planning as a way to help people better carry out regular physical activities. 

## Design
Though planning is a common strategy for people to achieve their personal goals on the physical activity level, people often fail to conduct their plans for various reasons. People might face a low intention to follow their plans, and their plans might be interrupted by unexpected incidents. 
This project will build a mobile planning tool that allows people to plan for regular physical activities by reflecting on their previous planning records. When planning for physical activities in this mobile app, people’s previous planning records will be present to them in a calendar view (like the figure on the right), alongside related contextual information, such as the weather and the temperature of that day. This app will also ask people to report if they have completed their plans at the end of the day and highlight the records on the calendar view. Users can reflect on how their plans are more likely to be conducted under different conditions.

## Implementation 
This app was developed using React Native with Expo. Expo provides a convenient way of developing mobile apps that can work on multiple platforms. This project also involves some third-party libraries to implement the functions needed for this app, including the notification function and different UI elements.
